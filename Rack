Rack:
               A node is generally a computer. It is a commodity hardware used to contain(store) data. A collection or storage of nodes
is called as a Rack. 
            A rack is generally a collection of 30 to 40 nodes. They are physically stored close together. They are interconnected to the same
network switch. 

    The concept of the network bandwidth between can be explained with a small logic given below:
    
            (Network bandwidth between 2 nodes in the same rack) > (Network bandwidth between 2 nodes in different racks)
      
      The above statement says that the Network bandwidth between two different nodes of the same rack is much greater than the  
network bandwidth of two nodes of different racks. 

Rack awareness: (Conceptual understanding):
              There is a concept in Hadoop called as Rack awareness which as an administrator we need to know. We can manually define the rack number
of each slave Data Node in your cluster. 
              
              We need to do this for two major reasons: Data loss prevention and Network performance. Assume we laod data into the cluster 
for processing. We have three copies of file that is being done by the system to prevent the failure of one machine from losing all copies of data.
It would sound awkward to lose all the valuable information. To avoid this the Name node will now where Data Nodes are located in the network technology and use that 
info to make an intelligent decision about where data replicas should exist in the cluster.   

        The major reason for having a rack in the hadoop system is to easily store and process data with a knowledge of where the data is 
        being stored and processed. It helps in future to track the functions performed during processing of data.
